  <p>I was proudly born and raised in the heart of Brooklyn, NY.
    My family relocated to Augusta, Georgia and had we not moved there,
    I would have not even acknowledge my love for art. My true passions are
    painting and photography. I am a recent graduate in Cinema and Photography
    with a Still Photography concentration from Ithaca College.
    I specialize in street, portrait, and event photography and I have a great
    eye for it as well, but I am good at photographing other things too.
    Most of my personal projects are inspired by my identity emotional, mentally
    and physically and I want to portray this to viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to my artsy side, I am a real outdoorsy person. I love
  backpacking, kayaking, whitewater rafting, rock climbing, and so much more. If
  I could pick where I wanted to live, I would pick London because I attended a
  study abroad program there and it completely changed me as a person and
  changed my outlook on my future. Personally, I believe art can influence
  the imagination that is needed in society to keep it thriving, so I support
  all who want to go into the arts for a career.</p>
